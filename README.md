# Peek_A_Boo
iOS App Development Project


I implemented Machine Learning and Object Oriented iOS Developement while creating this app. I created an app that can help you identify anything, from objects to animal breeds, from your photo library or camera. 

Required ML Model should be downloaded from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15v_gwFca3I9ETkxTDvek-oIKAC-YZwpo/view?usp=sharing and should be saved in the Resources folder.
